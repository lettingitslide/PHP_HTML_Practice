# PHP_HTML_Practice

This repository is where I am learning syntax and practicing HTML and PHP Scripting Language.

I am using Wampserver (Apache WebServer, OpenSSL, MySQL, PHP), Notepad++ and Eclipse.

Learning Resources are LinkedIn Learning and "PHP & MySQL server-side web development" by Jon Duckett.
